It remains largely\n","unreported due to the impunity, silence, stigma, and shame surrounding it.”\n","\n","In general terms, it manifests itself in physical, sexual, and psychological forms, encompassing:\n","- intimate partner violence (battering, psychological abuse, marital rape, femicide)\n","- sexual violence and harassment (rape, forced sexual acts, unwanted sexual advances,child sexual abuse, forced marriage, street harassment, stalking, cyber-harassment),human trafficking (slavery, sexual exploitation)\n","- female genital mutilation\n","- child marriage\n","\n","The data was taken from a survey of men and women in African, Asian, and South American countries, exploring the attitudes and perceived justifications given for committing acts of violence against women. The data also explores different sociodemographic groups that the respondents belong to, including: Education Level, Marital status, Employment, and Age group.\n","\n","It is, therefore, critical that the countries where these views are widespread, prioritize public\n","awareness campaigns, and access to education for women and girls, to communicate that\n","violence against women and girls is never acceptable or justifiable.\n","\n","- Record ID: Numeric value unique to each question by country\n","- Country: Country in which the survey was conducted\n","- Gender: Whether the respondents were Male or Female\n","- Demographics Question:Refers to the different types of demographic groupings used to segment respondents – marital status, education level, employment status, residence type, or age\n","-  Demographics Response: Refers to demographic segment into which the respondent falls (e.g. the age groupings are split into 15-24, 25-34, and 35-49)\n","- Survey Year: Year in which the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) took place. “DHS surveys are nationally-representative household surveys that provide data for a wide range of monitoring and impact evaluation indicators in the areas of population, health and nutrition. Standard DHS Surveys have large sample sizes (usually between 5,000 and 30,000 households) and typically are conducted around every 5 years, to allow comparisons over time.”\n","- Value : % of people surveyed in the relevant group who agree with the question (e.g. the percentage of women aged 15-24 in Afghanistan who agree that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife if she burns the food)\n","\n","Question | Respondents were asked if they agreed with the following statements:\n","\n","- A husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife if she burns the food\n","- A husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife if she argues with him\n","- A husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife if she goes out without telling him\n","- A husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife if she neglects the children\n","- A husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife if she refuses to have sex with him\n","- A husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife for at least one specific reason"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-09-24T00:46:18.71326Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-09-24T00:46:18.710699Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-09-24T00:46:20.181215Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["library(tidyverse)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-09-24T00:47:10.373658Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-09-24T00:47:10.342512Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-09-24T00:47:10.705461Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["violence
