<h1 align= "center"> Exploratory Data Analysis </h1>

## Datasets
This repository is open for Hacktoberfest contributors to analyze data  and bring their opensource skills in action.
Data Folder contains several interesting datasets . I have limited the datasets to excel and csv files to keep the thrill of data analysis intact.

### Social Datasets include -

* Indian Elections
* Air_Quality
* crime rates
* unemployment analysis


### Medical Datasets -
* Liver Disease Dataset

### Population -
* World Population


### Some links to other kaggle datasets I found unique-
